# Hugging Face `pipeline` Usage Guide

## What is a Pipeline?

Hugging Face `pipeline` is a high-level API that simplifies the use of machine learning models.  
- Runs powerful models with a single line of code, no complex configuration required.  
- Automatically loads the model, tokenizer, and necessary components.  
- Ideal for quick testing and prototyping.

## üîß Supported Core Tasks

| Task Name                  | Pipeline Key                | Description |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Text Classification        | `text-classification`       | Sentiment analysis, labeling |
| Question Answering         | `question-answering`        | Extract information from paragraphs |
| Translation                | `translation_xx_to_yy`      | Translate text between languages |
| Summarization              | `summarization`             | Summarize long texts |
| Named Entity Recognition (NER) | `ner`                 | Identify persons, places, organizations |
| Image Classification       | `image-classification`      | Recognize objects in images |
| Speech Recognition         | `automatic-speech-recognition` | Convert speech to text |

**Note:**  
- `device="cuda"`: Enables GPU usage. Use `device=-1` if no GPU is available.  
- Allows simple invocation and usage of models.  

## ‚úÖ Key Considerations

- Each pipeline type requires a model specifically trained for its task.  
- Empty or nonsensical text inputs may cause errors.  
- Ensure sufficient VRAM when using a GPU (some models are very large).  
- Very large models may lead to RAM/memory issues.

## üîê Token Permissions (For Pipeline Only)

For your Hugging Face token, grant only these permissions:  

**Inference**  
- ‚úÖ Use Inference API  
- ‚úÖ Call Inference Endpoints  

**Repositories (for model access)**  
- ‚úÖ Read access to all repository contents (especially within your namespace)

## üß™ Common Errors and Solutions

| Error                              | Description                     | Solution                          |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Using `"translation"`              | Ambiguous translation task      | Specify clearly, e.g., `translation_en_to_fr` |
| `device="cuda"` error              | No GPU available                | Use `device=-1` instead           |
| Short/empty input                  | Model may not work              | Provide meaningful text           |
| Model not found error              | Incorrect model name            | Verify the model name on Hugging Face Hub |
